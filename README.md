# abt-cli is a tool to generate cli source code in golang.
abt-cli generates a skeleton (codes and its directory structure) you need to start building Command Line Interface tool.
This would be your favorite CLI framework.

Stop writing the same codes every time. abt-cli generates them and save you a large amount of time by writing such code.
This will take your command structure in JSON format and generate codes and directory structure.

Only thing you have to do is just place your command description, JSON output structure in golang and your RESTAPI URL.

#Built-in commands are:
login 
logout 
exit 
help
